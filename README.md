# Formula Student Brake System Analysis Tool [V2.0.0]

A brake system analysis tool developed for Formula Student vehicles using React, FastAPI, and Python.

This project initially was python only as a Tkinter desktop application but after battling the GUI limitations, I decided to rebuild the entire thing using a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

In short, this project currently combines software development with Formula Student engineering. Most of my experience has been about working on my Formula Student team, so this became an opportunity to learn modern web development while building something I would actually use.

As the project grows, I plan to keep adding more detailed vehicle dynamics and brake system modelling features whenever I find the time.

## Getting It Running

### 1. Clone the repository

```terminal
git clone <repo-url>
cd Formula-Student-Brake-System-Tool
```

### 2. Setup the backend

```terminal
cd backend

python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux / Mac
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the backend server:

```terminal
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will run on:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Setup the frontend

Open a new terminal:

```terminal
cd frontend

npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Open the application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

The frontend will automatically communicate with the FastAPI backend.

## Current Limitations

This tool is intended for early-stage brake system analysis and design validation.

It does not replace physical testing, data acquisition, driver feedback, or detailed vehicle simulations.

The vehicle dynamics model is intentionally simplified to keep calculations fast and easy to interpret.

As more advanced modelling features are added, the accuracy and scope of the analysis will continue to improve.

## Future Plans

The long-term goal is to turn this into a more complete brake system design and validation platform.

That includes:

* More advanced vehicle dynamics models
* Brake thermal analysis
* Data visualization tools
* Setup optimization features
* Additional engineering validation checks

There's still a lot left to build, but that's part of the fun.
